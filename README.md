# Berkeley-AI-Pacman-Project
The UC Berkeley's AI Pacman project is an exciting initiative and an opportunity to showcase the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the classic arcade game Pac-Man.

### The project includes the following:

* A reflex agent that chooses an action at each choice point by examining its alternatives via a state evaluation function.
* An adversarial search agent that uses minimax to search for the best move.
* A reinforcement learning agent that learns to play Pac-Man by trial and error.
* A multi-agent system that allows the pacman to make decisions not just based on the food in the game's state, but it also makes decisions based on mulitple ghosts in the game.
